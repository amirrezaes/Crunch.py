# Pyrunch
Python script for crunch

It is not as fast as the orginal crunch which is written in C.
I will add multiprocessing in future.

    Usage: pylist.py <min> <max> <characters> <options>
    Options:
        -o         Set a name and directory for output file (defult is script directory)
        -h         Show help command
pretty simple ha :)
