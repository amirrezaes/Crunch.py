# Pyrunch
Python script for crunch

It is not as fast as the orginal crunch which is written in C but it is definitely faster than https://github.com/derv82/werdy/blob/master/crunch.py .
I will add multiprocessing in future.

    Usage: pyrunch.py <min> <max> <characters> <options>
    Options:
       -o         Set a name or directory for output file [defult: Script Path]
       -m         Memory Friendly mode(slightly slower) [default: off]
       -h         Show help command
pretty simple ha :)
